          <dt>The Challenge - Bringing back the light in three weeks</dt>
          <db>The Dreaming Zebra® Foundation needed to redesign their now 11-year-old website and, we had the opportunity to be part of this fun challenge. Besides needing an aesthetic redesign, the information architecture had no structure and just one way to get to pages from the navigation menu. Both a poor design and no organization resulted in users abandoning their site after not finding the organization's mission, how to contribute to it, or how to request donations. We had three weeks to fix this and help children get access to art and music supplies. </db>

        <dt>User Research & Findings</dt>
        <db>It was not an easy task to find people that contribute to non-profit organizations and beneficiaries of the Dreaming Zebra Foundation that were open for interviews and initial guerrilla tests on the old website. By reaching out to friends, and using social media we were able to find six users for our study.<br>We conducted five usability tests to understand both qualitative and quantitative data. We selected testers that either work for nonprofits, get benefited from nonprofits or, donate to nonprofits.</db>

    <db>We discovered that people prefer signing up for volunteering opportunities online. None of our participants choose the phone as a preferred method to sign up. 
        The Dreaming Zebra’s foundation website hierarchy had the phone number very visible on their hero banner. We later found out that people were not calling directly to be beneficiaries either. They just sign up online as well. 
        <br>
        We ended up removing the phone from the header section as part of our final prototype.</db>

    <db>80% of the people who continuously donate to non-profit organizations are busy with their families and work and prefer to contribute with money. 
      <br>
      After art materials, monetary donations are the most common contribution to The Dreaming Zebra Foundation.
      <br>
      The Monetary donation option is the first selector from left to right users to pick on our final prototype. While it is not the most accessible option when using the mobile version, it is the option they see first.

      <dt>Analysis - User Persona</dt>
      <db>With our research findings and problem statement in mind, we developed a persona that would take into account the goals and pain points of someone contributing and donating to the non-profit, and also someone who can benefit from it.
      <br>User scenario 1: Jenny is a kindergarten teacher who wants to get art supplies for her kindergartners. </db>
      <br>
      <db>User scenario 2: Jenny  also wants to donate any unused supplies at the end of the school year. </db>

      <db>1. Unclear information hierarchy - As we mentioned before, even the phone number caughts the eye before finding a call to action to donate, contribute or volunteer options. Or even finding out what is the organization’s mission. Similar situation wht the “Every child has a dream” quote.
        <br> 2. We noted the lack of search function.</db>

      <db>The style guide was created before the high fidelity prototype was created. We focused on creating figma components. We wanted to take an atomic design approach with developing our components first so we could easily scale design system between desktop and mobile versions.</db>

    <br>   
    <ul>
      <li>As a contributor, I want to know what is The Dreaming Zebra Foundation doing with my donations so that I can feel connected to the cause and keep helping out. </li>
      <li>As a beneficiary, I want to have a faster way to request support again without having to go through a 4 step form so that I can use my time teaching class instead of filling out a form.</li>
    </ul>
